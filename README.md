Deep Learning for Autonomous Robotic Grasping

# Objective
Primary: implement a novel deep learning architecture for pixel-wise detection of grasp poses and a pipeline to train/test the model.

Secondary: compare the novel architecure's performance on two well known grasp datasets, Cornell and Jacquard, to alternative architectures.
